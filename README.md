The  present  paper  objective  is  to  analyse  how  agiven kernel can be tuned to explore and to take advantage ofthe features that a computing platform offers. The kernel usedis matrix multiplication. Several optimizations and insights arepresented  about  it.  In  the  last  sections  some  implementationsand  time  measurements  of  the  kernel  for  a  many-core  server, Intel Knights Landing, and an accelerator, NVIDIA Kepler are presented.
